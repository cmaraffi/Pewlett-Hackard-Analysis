# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
This Analysis provides a few insights into the current workforce, headcount, and retiring employees. This review of the data and personnel is very important to those who are reviewing headcount. This enables the company to think about replacements for these individuals as well as any additional planning for pension costs or retirement benefit. From getting a list of the employees, to their most recent title, to getting a complete overview of the headcount by department of those individuals, paints a clear picture of Pewlett-Hackard's people and how to plan for the company's future successfully.

## Results: 

### Deliverable 1:
- The data isolates employees 65-68 years old who worked or work for Pewlett-Hackard.
- The unique titles displayes more filtered data and will enable better analysis of the needed replacements when  those individuals retire.
- The unique list contains 91K employees for the company which is much more narrowed down from the total employees, but the data needs to be filtered further.
- Of the total retiring tiles, Senior Engineer and Senior Staff are about 60K of the total retiring titles.
    - that is about 80% of all retiring titles

### Deliverable 2:
- Filtering and finding those individuals who have been with the company a while will be able to mentor some of the junior employees and help the company overall.
- All of the employees are current employees with at least 20 years of experience with Pewlett-Hackard. 
- This will also assist in the retiring titles because educating less experienced collegeues enables those with more experience to move into the retiring positions.
- Having a workforce that will continually pass down company knowledge and also gain knowledge from those with a new perspective and have outside experience.
